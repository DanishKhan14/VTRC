# VTRC

This project aims towards developing a system for local community engagement comprising of a main application hub (AppHub) and End User devices (mobile or static). 

The entire communication between these nodes needs to be build up on Wi-Fi and DTN technology which is easy to deploy and operate, affordable and semi-reliable with graceful degraded functionality when backbone network is lost. The platform will allow quick development of localized applications for day to day communication needs. Using data driven paradigm, it should be able to simplify and abstract the client and server implementations for the applications. End User Devices will carry the data with them like typical DTN ferries while the AppHub will be the Throwbox. AppHub will be the tracking, accounting element responsible for simplifying the deployment.

This is a work in progress. I'm in the mid of migrating codebase from Tortise SVN to GitHub for others to access. 
I'll be writing complete Readme with setup details soon !!
